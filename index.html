        <h1>SOME ABOUT ASTRONOMY</h1>
        <p>

Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.

                     <h3>Black Holes</h2>
                     <p>Black Hole is among the strongest object in the entire Universe. The gravity of that area is too much high that no one can escape from it - even light cannot escape from it. The time runs very slow near Black Hole</p>

                      <h3>Neutron Stars</h3>
                      <p>When an enormous star destroyed known as supernova explosion. In that case, one of two things may happen.  It may crush the core of the dead star with its own gravity, shrinking until it becomes more than an atom and becomes a black hole.</p>

                      <p>Till the 1920s we only know our Galaxyâ€“The Milky Way. Even with Telescopes, we can barely see spiral shapes in the sky and we wonder that what exactly they are? Is that a dusty Nebula or another galaxy?  </p>
